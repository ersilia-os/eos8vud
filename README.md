# SQUID 3D shape generation

Equivariant shape-conditioned generation of 3D molecules for ligand-based drug design. SQUID can generate chemically diverse molecules for arbitrary molecular shapes. Shape is defined by the input molecule.

## Identifiers

* EOS model ID: `eos8vud`
* Slug: `squid`

## Characteristics

* Input: `Compound`
* Input Shape: `Single`
* Task: `Generative`
* Output: `Compound`
* Output Type: `String`
* Output Shape: `List`
* Interpretation: Molecules matching the 3D shape of the input compound are suggested
